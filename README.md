# Mental-health-study
## Overview
This project investigates how climate and economic factors affect national suicide rates. The focus is on identifying which variables — such as average temperature, GDP per capita, unemployment, and inflation — are most strongly associated with suicide rates.

Using panel regression models in R, this study evaluates the impact of these variables across countries over time. Suicide rates are measured per 100,000 inhabitants and are broken down as follows:

- Overall population
- Male population
- Female population

## Methods
- Statistical approach: fixed effects panel regression models
- Software: R
- Data sources: WHO, World Bank, World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal
- Timeframe: 2000 - 2019
- Units of analysis : National level data

- Economic variables:
  - GDP per capita (constant USD)
  - Inflation (% annual change)
  - Unemployment(% of labour force)

- Health variables:
  - Alcohol consumption per capita (liters per year)

- Climate varaibles:
