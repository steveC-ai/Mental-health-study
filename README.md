In this project I study how climate and socieconomic variables affect suicide rates
The following project is an analysis on what variables affect suicide rates the most, using average temperature as a climate variable, and GDP per capita, unemployment and inflation as economic variables. Suicide rates are based on suicide per 100.000 habitants at a national level. There a three suicide rates: general suicide rate, male suicide rate and female suicide rate.
To study the relationship between these variables I use panel regression models on R.
